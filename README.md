# Cesar Verduzco Reyna's Project enhancement.

Hey CrediJusto Team and Optimhire Team, I'm glad to participate in this challenge. Sorry for the delay, I have to take care of my job first.
If I'm the winner of these challenge you can be sure I'll take care of the projects as well.

# ABOUT THIS PROJECT

There is room for improvement:

- Old fashion background
- No fonts
- Input style is basic
- Buttons are kind of the default
- Welcoming Card and the others for Crypto price history are unnecessary and ugly
- Crypto buttons when hovering the border makes it flicker and it feels weird
- When changing main Crypto to convert it, MX amount resets.
- Datetimes are not friendly
